  <h2>Debugging :</h2> 
  
  <p>
    - Try to run multiple times with different input
- Break a code in smaller part and test individual
- When I run code and encounter an error, I try to read the error message line by line in the browser's inspect tool to find out which line has the error in VS Code. This helps me identify where to look in my code (which file and which line). 
- I use console.log to check if anything is being displayed in the browser's inspect tool, check variables and their values
- Search on google how to solve that problem to find some example
- Reading the documentation to confirm the correct syntax and check Typo in the code
- Close and Re-open new terminal. (Kill Sever)
- Make sure install all the packet correctly
- Take a break and come back to it with fresh eyes can help to see the solution more clearly

    Collaborative Debugging:
  </h2>
  <p>
    - This will be similar to independent debugging, but working with more people or as a team can help us find the solution faster. 
- We will review the code together and check if there are any typos. 
- One person can suggest a solution to fix the typo, and the other person can implement the change. 
- We can also use console.log, inspect, and search on Google to help with the debugging process. 
- We will discuss the issue and keep trying until we find a solution. It's important to listen to each other, give suggestions in a polite way to avoid crashing, and be kind to each other.
- Take a break if need
