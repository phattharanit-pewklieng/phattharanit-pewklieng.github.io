    Humen Skill :

  <p>
    After pair programming each time both of us do reflection and take it to improve for next time. First week I did not really know what to say or the way to give feedback each time after pair programming yet. After Human Skill I start give my pair feedback. I try to do two feedback growth feedback which is give my pair a specific area that they need to work one. And also positive feedback.
    Also a group project, During conversation I apply what I learn from Human Skill. I make sure I listen carefully and building a positive team culture. Communicate clearly and check up with my team. During conversation and group with as we all discuss and share opinion before I respond I make sure, I understand and think before I say something back.
    Also when we had a lighting talk last week, when I give feedback to try to apply growth feedback and positive feedback during presentationâ€¨But still need to talk on it. As giving feedback to other people is challenging for me.
    In each week I try to improve myself of what I learn and I can feel that my speaking part is getting better. After I try.
    During my learning in bootcamp meeting new people and work as group and change pair programming each day make me gain confidence on my speaking part and how to give feedback to my team. before I use to say thing straight forward without thinking of other people feeling which is hurt my friend and my cord worker sometime before. Now I realise and careful of what I said.
