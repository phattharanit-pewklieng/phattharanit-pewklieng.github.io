  <h1>Wellbeing plan for Phase 1 of Bootcamp :</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <ul>
<li>Eating healthy food on time.</li>
<li>Taking a break if needed (such as when sitting in front of my computer for long - periods, taking a 10-minute break, and then returning).</li>
<li>If I get stuck with an error or issue, taking a break and coming back to it with a fresh mind. This will help me to be more productive.</li>
<li>Sleeping before midnight every day.</li>
<li>Exercising by walking (I walk to school and work back home every day, which is my daily exercise plan).</li>
<li>Attending a yoga class twice a week during the bootcamp.</li>
<li>Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated.</li>
<li>Taking a nap during the weekend if I work on my project or any coding.</li>
<li>Resting my eyes if they feel tired.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the first week until week 7: as a developer, we are not just coding; we need human skills as well as we work as a team and with other people.</p>

  I learned a lot from the Human Skill Class :
</h2>


<p>Since the first week until week 7: as a developer, we are not just coding; we need human skills as well as we work as a team and with other people.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Trust, Empathy and psychological safety in teams (Listening, Empathy, and Aroha): make sure to listen to other people carefully and make sure I understand them in the same way as they said that could cross miscommunication. Sharing and checking up on each other as we are the same team; this will help me with my listening and teamwork skill.</li>
  <li>Wellbeing, managing stress, resilience, and self-regulation: sometimes I tend to forget about wellbeing and take care of myself. I make a plan and try to follow the plan each week I have improved.</li>
  <li>Giving and receiving feedback: I learn how to give feedback and received feedback in a good way.</li>
  <li>Self-compassion and growth mindset: I make sure I always believed in myself that I can do it. Be kind to myself and others. It's challenging but nothing is impossible.</li>
  <li>Diversity and inclusion, bias, and stereotypes: everyone comes from a different background, and I try to understand each other and accept it. Know what to say and what not to say to avoid conflict and say it in a nice way.</li>
  <li>The hard conversations: communication and transforming conflict. Communication is the key; try to think before saying something.</li>
  </ul>

  

<p>
  I follow my plan and try to reflect on what I have done each day and whether I am on track. Normally, I do not eat lunch, but today I did. I did not have breakfast, but I ate some cereal before going to boot camp. I take a break if needed. I review what I have learned each day to reflect on what I need to study more. I try to finish all the Trello tasks and exercises within the same week to avoid building up my workload and to stay on track. I come up with questions for the facilitator for the next day. I check my Trello board weekly to see if anything is due or needs to be done and plan it daily what I have done and what I have to do next. I follow the Harakeke Bootcamp Wiki to catch up.
</p>

<p>Planning before boot camp and during boot camp are different. After I started the Harakeke Bootcamp, planning and wellbeing have become very helpful in keeping me on track. I tend to forget about them, but now I realize their importance. The HS class was really helpful in making my plan on track and paying attention to small things or things that I tend to overlook or forget.
