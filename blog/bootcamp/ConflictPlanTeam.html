  <h1>INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY :</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <ul>
<li>When I was part of a group project, I had a different opinion than the others. I listened to my team first, tried to understand why they did things a certain way, and then explained my thoughts to them. Everyone listened and asked me questions, and I gave them examples until they understood and agreed with me. If there were conflicts, we voted and accepted the outcome.</li>
<li>During the group project, if my team had different opinions, I listened to both sides and found out which one was correct by asking the facilitator, searching on Google, or by voting. That was very helpful for the project.</li>
<li>Most of the time, I didn't give comments or advice during group work because I was worried about making a mistake. However, my team gave me a chance and some advice to not be afraid. I realized that and tried to improve myself by talking more.</li>
<li>There was a time when one of my team members didn't listen to any of us and just did what they wanted. I let them do their thing and tried to find a soft way to talk to them and ask why or how I could help. There was no conflict, but it was hard because that person wasn't really listening. So I just kept checking on them and updating the group regularly on how they were doing. If they did something that was not right, I asked the facilitator to explain it to us. We needed a mediator to solve the issue.</li>
<li>I used Nonviolent Communication (NVC) techniques.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h1>TEAM ACTIVITY :</h1>
<div class="container">

  <p>We give each other feedback after a project on what we have to improve, and I provide feedback to my team.</p>
  <p>We agree on the same track and mostly vote to avoid conflicts. We choose the option with the most votes.</p>
  <p>I check on my team daily to see how they are feeling before we start working on the project, and I regularly check on each other to see if anyone needs help.</p>
  <p>We always communicate if anyone does something that was not part of the plan or their role to avoid conflicts. We check on everyone every 1 or 2 hours and keep each other updated on the work to ensure we are all on the same page.</p>
  <p>We take a 10-minute break every 2 hours, or if anyone needs a break, they let each other know. We have lunch together at 12:30 PM.</p>
  <p>We work every weekday, and weekends are optional. However, we ensure everyone has a break if they want to work on the weekend.</p>
  <p>We use Nonviolent Communication (NVC) techniques simple method for clear, empathic communication consisting of four steps: Stating observations, then feelings, then needs, then requests. NVC aims to find a way for all present to get what really matters to them without the use of guilt, humiliation, shame. We talk and make it clear to each other, Listening and if anything is not right or make any of us feel uncomfortable dont hide it just say it so we can fix to the right point.</p>
  <p>We bring snacks to share with each other.</p>
  <p>I check on my team before and after work on the project every day to ensure they are okay.</p>
</div>
  <h1>Prompts that I try to use during the project :</h1>

  <div class="container">
  <p>
    I try to notice if any of my team members are not okay before and during our project. If anything goes wrong, I ask my team what happened. If anyone on my team has a conflict, I talk to them one-on-one to find out what happened and resolve the issue before it gets worse. My team and I plan before starting the project and come up with many ideas. We vote on the final ideas and adapt to the best one. We assign roles and make it clear who is responsible for what. We check in on each other every hour and merge to ensure we are all working on the up-to-date version of the project. If any errors need to be corrected or changes need to be made, we discuss them together and assign tasks accordingly. During planning, we draw diagrams to help each other understand better. I check on everyone to ensure everyone understands everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    We create a timeline to help us understand when we start and when our break times are, which helps us stay on track and follow the plan. If we have to communicate during the weekend, we have a group chat for questions.
  </p>
<p>
  We have a framework and plan to follow. We always have a mediator or vote to avoid conflicts. I always ask my team questions when I am unsure to make sure that I am on track. It works very well.
</p>

<p>
  But we did not have any conflict during project. if any we will 1:1 talk to listen to both side and try to understand both of them and ask them to talk to each other what was the issue so we can fix together in the right spot.
</p>

<p>
  We give each other turn to talk and give some advise to make sure everyone of us in the same boat and work on the same page.
