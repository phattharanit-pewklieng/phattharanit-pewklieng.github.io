  <h1>Group Project Role and Reflection</h1>

  <div class="container">
  <h4>Week 2: Git Lead</h4>
It was our first week of the group project, and it did not go as well as we expected because we did not communicate with each other enough. We just did our parts, and at the end, we ran out of time. We had a lot of conflicts in GitHub commits, and I did not perform well in this first group project. Although we planned together, the work process did not go as we expected. But we learned from it and took away the reasons for our mistakes to the next project.

    <h4>Week 3: Vibes</h4>
    We planned together, took notes, and followed the steps while starting the project to ensure that we were all on track. This time, I was checking on my team to see how they were doing, and we communicated more to make sure everyone was working on the same page and on track, so we had fewer conflicts in GitHub in this group project. I also made sure that my team was okay.

      <h4>Week 4: Git Lead</h4>
      I had a chance to be the Git lead again, so I made sure to check on my team regularly and keep adding, committing, and pushing to check for up-to-date code to avoid conflicts. Even if there were any conflicts, it was okay because we checked regularly, and if we found any errors or conflicts, we had enough time to fix them.

      <div class="container">
        <h4>Week 5: Frontend Lead</h4>
        I worked on my code and asked my team to check and update what I had done and what I missed or added to my code. Once we merged our code, we reviewed the results together for feedback so we could work on what needed to be fixed or added. Communication was key to our success.
        </div>


        <div class="container">
          <h4>Week 6: Product Owner</h4>
          Although I was not the one who came up with the idea, after one of my team members shared the idea, we discussed and added it to our project. This project was our last group project, and I applied everything I had learned to this project. Even though our project outcome was not perfect, I found that our team worked very well because we kept checking on each other and tracking our work.
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <h4>What I learn from all of my group project is :</h4>
            - Teamwork.
            - Check on each other.
            - Communicate with each other if anything needs to be changed.
            - Don't work on other people's files or tasks. If you need to do something, you need to communicate and let them know.
            - Manage time effectively. Don't change things at the last minute. Check the time and prioritize all the important tasks that need to be done first.
            - Plan before starting.
            - Keep track of our work and make sure we are on the same page.
