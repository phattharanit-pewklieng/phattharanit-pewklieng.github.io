      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration :</h1>
      

<h4>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss 
  how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
 the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
 <p>
  A career change is a big decision for me. I carefully considered the potential 
  outcomes of my studies at Dev Academy and ultimately believed in both the program 
  and in myself, confident that I had made a good decision for my future. Thus far, 
  my studies have helped me to gain a better understanding of how to create websites, 
  and I feel that this is just the beginning of my new journey here.
</p>

 <h4>
  2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
 </h4>
 <p>
  In my culture, family and friends are very supportive. No matter what happens in our 
  lives, our families will always be there for us.
</p>

 <h4>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
 <p>
  I am a hard worker, and I believe that my dedication to achieving my goals will help 
  me succeed in becoming a web developer. With the support I receive from Dev Academy, 
  I am confident that I will be able to achieve my career aspirations.
</p>

 <h4>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. 
  How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
 <p>
  My limitation is my language, as English is my second language. Sometimes, I find 
  it challenging to improve my writing and listening skills.
</p>
 <h4>
  5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, 
  but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, 
  how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
 </h4>
 <p>
  I always check in with my team to see how they're doing and ask them to share 
  what's going on, so I can help and support them in the right way. I stay positive 
  and try to make my team smile during work, because I believe that when everyone is 
  happy and engaged, it creates a good environment for collaboration and leads to 
  better outcomes. If there is resistance or tension, I try to listen actively, 
  empathize with others, and find common ground to resolve any issues. However, 
  if these strategies don't work, I would seek advice from a mentor or a supervisor 
  to find alternative ways to work productively with others.
