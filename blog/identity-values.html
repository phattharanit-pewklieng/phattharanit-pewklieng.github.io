<h4>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
 the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
 <p>Career change is the big decision for me. I weighed the outcome of my study at Dev Academy and I believed in Dev Academy and myself, that I make  good decision for my future.
  So far of my study here, it helps me to understand more about how to make website and this just the begining of my new jorney here. 
 </p>

 <h4>
  2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
 </h4>
 <p>
  In sour culture, our family and friend are really suportive. No matther what happen in our life our family will always there for us.
</p>

 <h4>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
 <p>Hard working, I work hard for what I want. As my goal now is, become a web Developer with my strength and support from Dev Academy I think it will help me successful</p>

 <h4>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
 <p>My language, as English is my second language it will be a bit hard for me sometime with writing and listen skill. </p>
 <h4>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
 </h4>
 <p>I always check up on my team how they are doing and ask them what happen so they can share to me why, or what going so I can help them and support them 
  in the right spot. I think positive and try my best to make my team smile during work. Becasue if everyone enjoy and keep smile during work
  I feel it is a good environment to work together and the outcome of work alwasys good.
