            <h2>Foundations Core Skills </h2>
            <h4>
              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego 
              due to the core learning?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Three new things that I have learned through core learning are emotional intelligence, 
              listening and looping, and neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I didn't used to listen carefully 
              to people who were talking to me, so I didn't always understand what they were trying to say, 
              and this caused me to misunderstand many times. Also, the concept of growth mindset has helped 
              me to realize that I can overcome my self-doubts, such as when I thought I couldn't code. 
              By being kind to myself and believing that I can, I think nothing is impossible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Core learning has helped me understand myself better and has enabled me to treat others in a 
              more positive and respectful manner. I have learned to adopt a positive mindset and take 
              responsibility for my actions instead of blaming others.
            </p>

            <h4>
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
            </h4>

            <p>
              Values play a crucial role in learning and programming as they provide a framework for 
              how we interact with others, approach problem-solving, and make decisions. By having a 
              clear understanding of our values, we can ensure that our actions and decisions align 
              with what we believe to be important and meaningful.
            </p>


              <p>
                Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, and it is crucial in 
                programming because it helps developers to create user-friendly and accessible programs that 
                meet the needs of their users. By being empathetic, developers can design software that is 
                intuitive and easy to use, which in turn leads to better user experiences.
              </p>

              <p>
                Self-awareness is also important in learning and programming because it enables individuals to 
                identify their strengths and weaknesses, and to be open to feedback and learning opportunities. 
                Being self-aware means recognizing one's limitations, asking for help when needed, and taking 
                responsibility for one's mistakes. In programming, self-awareness is particularly important as 
                it can help to prevent errors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
              </p>
            <h4>
              What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h4>

            <p>
              Emotional Intelligence helps me to understand other people and know how to control my emotions. 
              This has really helped me to reflect on myself and not repeat the same mistakes in how I treat people and myself.
            </p>

            <h4>
              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h4>

            <p>
              It was a bit hard to believe that I could do it, especially since I don't consider 
              myself very smart and my memory is not that good, which sometimes brings me down. However, 
              I know that everything takes time and that if I keep learning, I will get there one day.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
              learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </h4>

            <p>
              
              Learning emotional intelligence, listening and looping, and growth mindset in bootcamp 
              has been incredibly helpful for me. It has allowed me to better understand myself and the 
              people around me, and to get along well with others in a team setting. I now have a better
               understanding of the importance of asking for help when needed and of the key factors 
               in problem-solving. These skills have set me up for success in future roles, whether in 
               a teamwork or leadership position.
              
            </p>

            <h4>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
               have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h4>

            <p>
              I don't think it's a waste of time at all. It has helped me to understand my past mistakes 
              and avoid repeating them. Using the core learning principles as my guide for my new journey 
              in this industry gives me confidence and helps me to work better with others on campus. 
              It has also improved my leadership skills, teamwork abilities, time management, planning, 
              problem-solving, and goal-setting, all of which will lead to my success in the future.
