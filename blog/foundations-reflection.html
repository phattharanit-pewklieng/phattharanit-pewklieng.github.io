              and growth mindset. As I dont really listening to people who talking to me
              carefully so I dont really understand what they try to say and make me misunderstand 
              many time. Also Growth mindset as often think I can't code and many things That
              I think I cant I just realise if I be kind to myself and believe that I can, 
              I think nothing is impossible.

              control emotional. This is really help me to understand how I was before and reflect 
              myself that I should not do the same mistake of how I treat people and myself.

            <h4>
              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h4>

            <p>
              It was abit hard to think that I can do but I know I can't as 
              I know that I am not smart and my memory is not that good this push myself down sometime. But 
              I know everything take time if Im not stop learning I will get there one day.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
              learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </h4>

            <p>
              Help me to understand myself and and other people around me. Also help me to get along with other 
              people very well in bootcamp and set up for teamwork in the future role. Or leadership role. When I need Help
              I know how to ask for help nicely. Understand the important key with how to solve problem.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
               have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h4>

            <p>
              I think, It's not wasting time at all It helps me to understand myself of what I have done before 
              and why I should not do the same. by using core learning to be my guildline for my new jouerney in this industry. 
              This will help myself be confidence and get along with other people in campus better.
              This help me with my leardership skill, teamwork, time manangment,Planing, problem solving and set up my goal 
              to success in the future.
