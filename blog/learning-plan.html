          <h1>Learning Plane :</h1>
          <h2><u>Bootcamp :</u></h2>
          <p>My Long term goal I would like to develop me tech skill and start my career in Tech. I believe this will help me 
            to gian more experience from here.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            My biggest strength, I like to learn new things to build up my knowledge. My language my be my limitations
            as English is not my first language, It may be a bit hard to me to understand thing all at once go.
            Im lukcy that during Foundations when I struck on something and ask for help all Facilitators are very nice
            and explain everything very clear in the easy way. That's very helpful for me.
          </p>
  
          <p>This non-technical challenge will be a good challenge for me to gian more confidence of
            talking and asking people for help if need. Learning and shearing knowledge to each other
            this will help me working as team and not be shy to speak up in front of many poeple.
            Shearing feedback and receiving feedback, also this will help me to develop my
            leadership, communication, teamwork, self-awareness and reflective skills. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I expect lots of support like how Foundations had.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Meet lots of people and I can learn from people around me.
            develop all the skill that I leak. Enjoy study with other students.
          </p>

            <h2><u>Foundations : </u></h2>
          <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long term goal, I would like to complete this course and I would like to be frontend or backend developer then after I gain some experience and be a full stack web developer. 
        </p>
        <h4>2. Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>
          My strengths, hardworking and always think positive. I dont give up easily and learn from my mistake. And I always believe that nothing impossible for me. 
        </p>
        <h4>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
        As my english is my second language sometime I did not understand all at once. Also my writing skill that I need to work on. 
        Sometime I can be shy person in front of new people that I just know. 
        I need to be confidence to talk and ask more. 
        </p>
        <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
        <h4>* An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
          <p>I need to manage my time very well on each topic. Take down some note for my weekly plan.</p>
        <h4>* What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
        <p>This week, sprint2 I think we had a lot to do: html, css exercise, create blog and website. Once It happens to me,
        I look at structure and slowly take down some not to finalise what I have done and what not then I slowly did each task and tick off from my list.
        in this case I feel, It's not overwhelming to me.
        </p>
        <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>I normaly try my best to fix problem or any issue by myself first. Sometime, look at the screen for long time and still stuck 
          on that error I take a break and come back and try again by search more on google. But if I still cant fix I will message on discord to ask for help. 
        </p>
        <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          Support from them. and my Facilitators are very helpfully and supportive. when I ask question they always respont very fast. 
        </p>
        <h4>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>I manage my time very well and I did not working anywhere. So all my time only focus on study at Dev Academy.</p>
