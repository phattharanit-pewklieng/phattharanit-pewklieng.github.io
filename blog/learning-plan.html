          <ul>
        <li>Eating healthy food on time.</li>
        <li>Taking a break if needed (such as when sitting in front of my computer for long - periods, taking a 10-minute break, and then returning).</li>
        <li>If I get stuck with an error or issue, taking a break and coming back to it with a fresh mind. This will help me to be more productive.</li>
        <li>Sleeping before midnight every day.</li>
        <li>Exercising by walking (I walk to school and work back home every day, which is my daily exercise plan).</li>
        <li>Attending a yoga class twice a week during the bootcamp.</li>
        <li>Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated.</li>
        <li>Taking a nap during the weekend if I work on my project or any coding.</li>
        <li>Resting my eyes if they feel tired.</li>

        <h3>I learned a lot from the Human Skill Class: End Of Bootcamp :</h3>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Since the first week until week 7: as a developer, we are not just coding; we need human skills as well as we work as a team and with other people.</p>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Trust, Empathy and psychological safety in teams (Listening, Empathy, and Aroha): make sure to listen to other people carefully and make sure I understand them in the same way as they said that could cross miscommunication. Sharing and checking up on each other as we are the same team; this will help me with my listening and teamwork skill.</li>
          <li>Wellbeing, managing stress, resilience, and self-regulation: sometimes I tend to forget about wellbeing and take care of myself. I make a plan and try to follow the plan each week I have improved.</li>
          <li>Giving and receiving feedback: I learn how to give feedback and received feedback in a good way.</li>
          <li>Self-compassion and growth mindset: I make sure I always believed in myself that I can do it. Be kind to myself and others. It's challenging but nothing is impossible.</li>
          <li>Diversity and inclusion, bias, and stereotypes: everyone comes from a different background, and I try to understand each other and accept it. Know what to say and what not to say to avoid conflict and say it in a nice way.</li>
          <li>The hard conversations: communication and transforming conflict. Communication is the key; try to think before saying something.</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          I follow my plan and try to reflect on what I have done each day and whether I am on track. Normally, I do not eat lunch, but today I did. I did not have breakfast, but I ate some cereal before going to boot camp. I take a break if needed. I review what I have learned each day to reflect on what I need to study more. I try to finish all the Trello tasks and exercises within the same week to avoid building up my workload and to stay on track. I come up with questions for the facilitator for the next day. I check my Trello board weekly to see if anything is due or needs to be done and plan it daily what I have done and what I have to do next. I follow the Harakeke Bootcamp Wiki to catch up.
        </p>
        
        <p>Planning before boot camp and during boot camp are different. After I started the Harakeke Bootcamp, planning and wellbeing have become very helpful in keeping me on track. I tend to forget about them, but now I realize their importance. The HS class was really helpful in making my plan on track and paying attention to small things or things that I tend to overlook or forget.

          <h1>Learning Plane :</h1>
          <h2><u>Bootcamp :</u></h2>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to develop my tech skills and start my career in the tech industry. 
            I believe this will help me gain more experience and knowledge.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            My biggest strength is my desire to learn new things and build up my knowledge. However, 
            my language skills may limit me as English is not my first language, making it a bit difficult 
            for me to understand things all at once. Luckily, during Foundations, when I got stuck on something and 
            asked for help, all the facilitators were very nice and explained everything clearly in an easy way. 
            That was very helpful for me.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            
            This non-technical challenge will be a good opportunity for me to gain more confidence 
            in talking to people and asking for help when needed. Learning and sharing knowledge with 
            others will help me work better as a team and not be shy to speak up in front of many people. 
            Sharing and receiving feedback will also help me develop my leadership, communication, teamwork, 
            self-awareness, and reflective skills.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I expect to receive lots of support like I did during Foundations, meet lots of people, and learn 
            from those around me, while developing all the skills that I lack. I'm looking forward to enjoying 
            studying with other students.
          </p>

            <h2><u>Foundations : </u></h2>
        <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to complete this course and become a front-end or back-end developer, and then gain experience to become a full-stack web developer.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>
          My strengths include being hardworking, always thinking positively, not giving up easily, and learning from my mistakes. I believe that nothing is impossible for me.
        </p>
        <h4>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my non-technical core skills, such as improving my understanding of English, developing my writing skills, and becoming more confident in talking and asking questions in front of new people.
      </p>
        <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
        <h4>* An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
        <h4>* What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
        <p>
          To manage my workload, I will create a weekly plan and take notes on each topic. When things are building up, I will break down the tasks and slowly work through them. If I need help, I will message on Discord to ask for assistance.
        </p>
        <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>
          I will try to fix any problems or issues by myself first, and if I am still stuck, I will take a break and then search for more information on Google. If I am still unable to solve the problem, I will message on Discord to ask for help.
        </p>
        <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to provide support and be helpful and responsive when I have questions or need assistance.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>
          I do not have any block-out times or other commitments as I am fully committed to studying at Dev Academy.
