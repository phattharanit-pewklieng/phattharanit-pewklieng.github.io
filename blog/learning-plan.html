          <h2><u>Bootcamp :</u></h2>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to develop my tech skills and start my career in the tech industry. 
            I believe this will help me gain more experience and knowledge.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            My biggest strength is my desire to learn new things and build up my knowledge. However, 
            my language skills may limit me as English is not my first language, making it a bit difficult 
            for me to understand things all at once. Luckily, during Foundations, when I got stuck on something and 
            asked for help, all the facilitators were very nice and explained everything clearly in an easy way. 
            That was very helpful for me.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            
            This non-technical challenge will be a good opportunity for me to gain more confidence 
            in talking to people and asking for help when needed. Learning and sharing knowledge with 
            others will help me work better as a team and not be shy to speak up in front of many people. 
            Sharing and receiving feedback will also help me develop my leadership, communication, teamwork, 
            self-awareness, and reflective skills.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I expect to receive lots of support like I did during Foundations, meet lots of people, and learn 
            from those around me, while developing all the skills that I lack. I'm looking forward to enjoying 
            studying with other students.

            <h2><u>Foundations : </u></h2>
        <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to complete this course and become a front-end or back-end developer, and then gain experience to become a full-stack web developer.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>
          My strengths include being hardworking, always thinking positively, not giving up easily, and learning from my mistakes. I believe that nothing is impossible for me.
        </p>
        <h4>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my non-technical core skills, such as improving my understanding of English, developing my writing skills, and becoming more confident in talking and asking questions in front of new people.
      </p>
        <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
        <h4>* An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
        <h4>* What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
        <p>
          To manage my workload, I will create a weekly plan and take notes on each topic. When things are building up, I will break down the tasks and slowly work through them. If I need help, I will message on Discord to ask for assistance.
        </p>
        <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>
          I will try to fix any problems or issues by myself first, and if I am still stuck, I will take a break and then search for more information on Google. If I am still unable to solve the problem, I will message on Discord to ask for help.
        </p>
        <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to provide support and be helpful and responsive when I have questions or need assistance.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>
          I do not have any block-out times or other commitments as I am fully committed to studying at Dev Academy.
