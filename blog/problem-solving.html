          <h1>Technical Blog - Problem Solving : </h1>
        
 
     <p>
      This week (sprint4) has been tough for me as I've spent most of my time 
      reading and watching JavaScript videos to improve my understanding of it.
      </p>
    <h4>Were blocked on a simple problem :</h4>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, I got stuck on a simple problem with the JavaScript Kata. 
      I tried to follow the video and keep coding, but my code wasn't passing the test. 
      I didn't want to ask for help right away because I knew I wouldn't truly understand 
      the solution if I just got the answer. I believe that making mistakes is part of the 
      learning process. I'm still struggling to fully understand the testing code. 
    </p>

 
    <h4>Elegantly solved a problem :</h4>
    <p>On a positive note, I elegantly solved a problem with manipulating objects, 
      despite the many layers and dot notation. I tried to follow the instructions 
      but didn't quite grasp it. So, I went back and did more research by searching 
      Google and reading line by line. This helped me better understand the concept. 
      When I went back to the code, I was able to read the error messages and fix them by myself. 
      I felt relieved when I saw a few ticks appear on the npm test.
    </p>

    <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes :</h4>
    <p><span>7/10</span> <u>Pseudocode :</u> Help me line by line what I need to create by following each step from it.  </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span> <u>Trying something :</u> Try to code in shorter way look easy but a bit hard to understand about the code.
      So I did not try any much yet.
    </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span><u>Rubber ducky method :</u> I tried to plain the program line-by-line to a rubber duck. 
      Often, the act of explaining the problem step by step will cause the solution to present itself. 
      I did not use Rubber ducky method much yet</p>
    <p><span>7/10</span><u>Reading error messages :</u> Reading from error messages is still a bit hard for me as I did not 
                        understand some of key work on coding fully yet.
    </p>
    <p><span>8/10</span><u>Console.logging :</u> Help me U know what the result look like and easy to understand and readable.</p>
    <p><span>8/10</span><u>Googling :</u> Searching what I need to know by using Google is the best way to get what 
                        what I want to know. Specaily with the trick.
    </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span><u>Asking your peers for help :</u> I did not ask much help as I was shy. sometime I thought my question 
                        may look silly.
    </p>
    <p><span>5/10</span><u>Asking coaches for help :</u> I did ask but not that much, when I think I can do it. I need to ask more Help
                        from coaches.                  
    </p>
    <p><span>7/10</span><u>Improving your process with reflection :</u> Reflection is very helpfully tools for me to check up on myself of each week
      what am I up to. Which area I need to work on to catch up and understand more.
