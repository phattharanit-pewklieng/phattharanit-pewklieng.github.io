          <h1>Technical Blog - Problem Solving : </h1>
        
 
     <p>This week <span>(sprint4)</span> is also anther tough week for me. I spend most of my time
        reading and watching most of the videos about Java-Script to understand.
     </p>
    <h4>Were blocked on a simple problem :</h4>

       <p>I had a hard time with all the <span>JavaScript Kata</span> I tried to figure it out by follow the video And
       keep coding. I test the code but It was not pass. I try not to ask right away because if I ask I may just get the 
       anwser without understand. I known that if I make mistake I will learn from it. I dont really understandfully 
       with all the testing code yet. 
    </p>

 
    <h4>Elegantly solved a problem :</h4>
    <p>I was stuck on the <span>Manipulating Objects</span> as It had so many layer and dot notation. 
      I did it by follow the struction but still did not get it. I tried to go back and read more by searching google. 
      And read line by line it works. Then I wend back to code again, It was very helpful for me. When I was stuck 
      on some error and I be able to read the error and fix it by myself. I feel relieve when I start seeing 
      few tick that appear on the npm test.
    </p>

    <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes :</h4>
    <p><span>7/10</span> <u>Pseudocode :</u> Help me line by line what I need to create by following each step from it.  </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span> <u>Trying something :</u> Try to code in shorter way look easy but a bit hard to understand about the code.
      So I did not try any much yet.
    </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span><u>Rubber ducky method :</u> I tried to plain the program line-by-line to a rubber duck. 
      Often, the act of explaining the problem step by step will cause the solution to present itself. 
      I did not use Rubber ducky method much yet</p>
    <p><span>7/10</span><u>Reading error messages :</u> Reading from error messages is still a bit hard for me as I did not 
                        understand some of key work on coding fully yet.
    </p>
    <p><span>8/10</span><u>Console.logging :</u> Help me U know what the result look like and easy to understand and readable.</p>
    <p><span>8/10</span><u>Googling :</u> Searching what I need to know by using Google is the best way to get what 
                        what I want to know. Specaily with the trick.
    </p>
    <p><span>3/10</span><u>Asking your peers for help :</u> I did not ask much help as I was shy. sometime I thought my question 
                        may look silly.
    </p>
    <p><span>5/10</span><u>Asking coaches for help :</u> I did ask but not that much, when I think I can do it. I need to ask more Help
                        from coaches.                  
    </p>
    <p><span>7/10</span><u>Improving your process with reflection :</u> Reflection is very helpfully tools for me to check up on myself of each week
      what am I up to. Which area I need to work on to catch up and understand more.
